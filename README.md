# AITA Judge Bot FAQ

## Basics

1. What is Judge Bot?

    Judge Bot is program that makes predictions about the outcomes of posts on the [AITA (Am I the Asshole) subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/). These predictions are based on a neural network that has been trained to do this task.

2. What is the AITA subreddit? What exactly is Judge Bot predicting?

    AITA is a reddit forum (AKA a subreddit) where people describe a situation that happened to them, and ask if they were in the wrong. Others can comment on these posts and vote about whether the original poster was in the wrong.  The main vote options are YTA (you're the asshole) and NTA (not the asshole). The comment that gets the most votes determines whether the original poster is deemed to be an asshole or not.

    Judge bot finds new posts, and predicts the outcome of the reddit vote. Judge bot tweets that start with "PREDICTION UPDATE:" are tweets where Judge bot assesses whether it was correct on a prior prediction, after the reddit vote is in.
